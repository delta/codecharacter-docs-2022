# Competition Guide

Ultimately, Codecharacter is a game of competition! The objective is to challenge other players and fight your way to the top of the leaderboard.

You can type your code in the Code Editor and click on the <code>Submit</code> button to submit your code to the leaderboard.

<br />
This will allow you to challenge anyone on the leaderboard with the submitted
code. To challenge another player, simply click the challenge button (sword icon) 
next to their nickname on the leaderboard. You can keep updating and
submitting your code as and when you want.
<br />
<br />
Note that once you submit a code, anyone can challenge you at anytime, and a match
will automatically be simulated between you and the opposing player. You will receive
a notification once the match ends, and you can view it in the <code>
    Battle TV
</code>
. Click on any of the maps below each match to see that match.
<br />
You can also save different versions of your code by using the commit button on
the top bar. Using the <code>Commits</code> Tab on the dashboard. A match can be
initiated by you against the previous version of your own code.
<br />
The list of matches youâ€™ve played and top rated matches by other players are
also available to watch on the <code>Battle TV</code>.

The leaderboard evaluates your position using your rating, which is based purely
on the outcomes of your matches with other players. The Glicko ranking mechanism
is used to calculate ranks. Players who are more actively playing matches are rewarded
by this rating system as they tend to suffer lesser fall in ratings.
