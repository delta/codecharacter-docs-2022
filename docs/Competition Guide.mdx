# Competition Guide

Ultimately, CodeCharacter is a game of competition! The objective is to challenge other players and fight your way to the top of the leaderboard.
Just to keep up the spirit of fair competition, the first three days will be practice days and will not officially affect your ratings.

<br />
Let us go through these buttons in order:
<ol>
    <li><b>The Save button</b>: To save your present code</li>
    <li><b>The Simulate button</b>: To simulate a self-match with your own map and code</li>
    <li><b>The Commit button</b>: To commit your existing code into the commit history</li>
    <li><b>The Submit button</b>: This will submit your present code to the leaderboard</li>
</ol>
Note that once you submit a code, anyone can challenge you at anytime, and a match
will automatically be simulated between you and the opposing player. You will receive
a notification once the match ends, and you can view it in the <code>
    Battle TV
</code>
. Click on any of the maps below each match to see that match.
<br />
<br />
You can also save different versions of your code by using the commit button on
the top bar. Using the <code>Commits</code> Tab on the dashboard. A match can be
initiated by you against the previous version of your own code.
<br />
<br />
The list of matches you’ve played and top rated matches by other players are
also available to watch on the <code>Battle TV</code>.

<h3>Tier System</h3>
The participants are divided into two tiers based on their rankings. While the players in the first tier will be able to compete in matches, 
their ratings will only be affected by the automatches that are run among the first tier.
<br />
The second tier participants however can choose the player they want to attack and will have awarded points that affect their rating for 
the same
<br />
There is a promotion algorithm that keeps pushing the most competitive and successful players into the top tier.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Leaderboard </h3>
The leaderboard evaluates your position using your rating, which is based purely
on the outcomes of your matches with other players. The Glicko ranking mechanism
is used to calculate ranks. Players who are more actively playing matches are rewarded
by this rating system as they tend to suffer lesser fall in ratings.
