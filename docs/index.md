# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the player documentation for Code Character!

Code Character is a strategy based programming game where you control troops in a turn-based game with the code you write in one of the multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Java) available in the game. The objective is to destroy and vanquish the opponent's territory by writing code and creating defenses via the in-game map. With progress and implementation of new competitive strategies, fight your way through, and dominate the top of the leaderboard.

Let’s get started with a quick tutorial on how to get started.

## Dashboard Interface

You need to register to get started. You can register using email verification or using the google or github OAuth. Once registered you can use the credentials to login to the game.

Once you log in, you’ll see your dashboard, as shown in the image below.

On the left there is the sidebar, with multiple of icons. Lets go one by one -

-   Code Editor - where you would be writing code in language of your choice.

-   Map Designer - You would be designing the map by putting your tower of your choice.

-   Leadeboard - Leadeboard showing where you stand among other players, you can also initiate a match against player from the page.

-   Commits - This page shows the commit history of map and code which you would have saved.

-   BattleTV - Your previous matches and its result. You can also watch the watch the replay of match.

-   Settings - Settings of the games fonts, themes and keybindings etc.

And on the screen you can see three partitions:

-   **On the left is the editor**, where you can type your code. You’ll notice on logging in, that you’re provided some default code. It doesn’t do much in terms of strategy, but it uses most of the important elements of the code API, so a quick read through it will help.

-   **On the bottom right is the debug window**, it shows your compilation errors at compile time and your debug logs and errors at runtime.

-   **On the top right is the renderer window**, which actually displays your game. Use the mouse to pan around, and view your game after it’s complete.
