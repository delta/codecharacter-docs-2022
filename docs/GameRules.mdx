# Game Rules

Codecharacter is a game of strategic resource management. The objective of the game for the attacker is to destroy the defender's base as much as possible using the least number of coins possible. The defender’s objective is to kill the enemy attacking the base and save it.

There are two types of units:

<ul>
  <li>Three types of towers</li>
  <li>Three types of troops</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<b>Towers</b> - Towers are static and stay in their position and attack when
troops reach their range. Each tower has their own values and attributes. One of the 
towers can defend the aerial troops while the other can defend the ground troops.

<b>Troops</b> - Troops can move and attack when defenders come in range. Troops can only be spawned in the outer region of the map.
There are two ground troops and one aerial troop with their own characteristics which make each one unique.

Towers occupy a 1x1 square unit area on the map in an isometric view and troops cannot move through a tower. Troops attack the tower till its health drops completely. Towers are destroyed once their health reaches zero

Towers can be constructed on the tile till you have coins left in the store. Troops can be spawned through your code.

This is what a game map looks like :

<br />
<b>Goal of the game </b> - The attackers goal in the game is to destroy defender
bases as much as possible using as minimum an amount of coins as possible and the defender’s goal
is to kill the enemy attacking and save the base.
<br />
You will be given a fixed amount of coins to build your defender base. Your attackers and their spwaning location will be determined by
the code you write.
<br />
<br />
In the PvP game mode, your goal will be to outsmart your opponent and defeat all his attackers with your attackers.
